This repository contains config files to set up my systems and keep them in sync.

It mainly consists of:

* MacOSX defaults
* tmux config
* (oh-my-)zsh config
* a global editorconfig, csscomb and jshint config
* a script to mount a folder in my Dropbox which is encrpyted with EncFS
* many many homebrew packages and some git-repositories
* and the Ubuntu Font Family. I use Ubuntu Mono as favorite codeing font.

I'm using Sublime Text 3 as main editor. Its config remains in a Dropbox folder to sync between my systems, so nothing to see here, yet.

# dotfiles 

This repository contains config files to set up my systems and keep them in sync.

It mainly consists of:

* MacOSX defaults
* tmux config
* (oh-my-)zsh config
* many many homebrew packages and some git-repositories

I'm using Sublime Text 3 as main editor. Its config remains in a Dropbox folder to sync between my systems, so nothing to see here, yet.
